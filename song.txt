I'm not invited to the party
Been sitting here all night
I'm all alone here at the party
I don't feel all right
Ain't got no black coat
Ain't got no tie
I gotta shape up now
Come on baby you gotta know why

Take off!
Dancer, Dancer
I can't live with it I'm gonna die without it
Dancer, Dancer
Ain't no doubt about it
Dancer, Dancer
Why don't you kick off your dancing shoes
And come and ride with me?
Cool!

You're the life and soul of the funk-tion
It took me all night
To get hold of the right introduction
Blew me out of sight
I taste your lipstick
I look in your eyes
You feel fantastic
My body cries

Dancer, Dancer
I can't live with it I'm gonna die without it
Dancer, Dancer
Ain't no doubt about it
Dancer, Dancer
Why don't you kick off your dancing shoes
And come and ride with me
Hot space, let's go!

Dancer, Dancer
I can't believe your dancing
Dancer, Dancer
Can't take you home, can't take you dancing
Dancer, Dancer
Bring out the funk and dance the night away
Dancer, Dancer...
